SA-toolkit is a [pytorch](https://pytorch.org/)-based library providing pipelines and basic building blocs designing speaker anonymization techniques.  
This library is the result of the work of Pierre Champion's [thesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04455).  

The extraction of content features is based on the ASR part in the SA-toolkit.

## Installation

### :snake: conda
The best way to install the SA-toolkit is with the `install.sh` script, which setup a micromamba environment, and kaldi.  
Take a look at the script and adapt it to your cluster configuration, or leave it do it's magic.  
This install is recommended for training ASR models.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/deep-privacy/SA-toolkit
./install.sh
```

### :package: pip
Another way of installing SA-toolkit is with pip3, this will setup everything for inference/testing.  
```sh
pip3 install 'git+https://github.com/deep-privacy/SA-toolkit.git@master#egg=satools&subdirectory=satools'
```
